SPI takes four lines: SCLK, MOSI, MISO, SS
SCLK (master) -> SCLK (Slave)
MOSI (master) -> MOSI (Slave)
MISO (master) <- MISO (Slave)
SS (master) -> SS (Slave)

If we want to connect to multiple SPI,just connect to another SS for each SPI, but keeps high for unused, low for used

SPI is asynchrounous communication protocol

master generates clock

Video uses Full Duplex Master Mode
Use USART to transfer data
Has to find SPI_SCK
SPI1_MISO
SPI1_MOSI
GPIO_OUTPUT(?)
